# ALIGNER

An Ai powered time manager and Todo list app; helps you manage your task timelapse without confusing.

at the moment I face a hard time picking up with task to start my day with (the todayâ€™s assignments with 10marks or tomorrows 20marks assignment). so with this program that time used to loose picking up your next task goes outâ€¦

## The Idea

the idea of this project is to build a web app with i want to transform it to an app later when I get the knowledge.

you insert your task by filling a form and set the timelapse of each task, then you align them as (urgent task, Important Task) by dragging them into a boxes. and after that is when the AI magic comesâ€¦ it tells you which task to start with and with to do next. and it guides you when needed (optional).


## keep in mind
after you run the project you may not see it as it supposed to.
to see it as it supposed to... open the Inspect Element or click ` Ctrl + Shift + I ` and set it to a smart phone size ` 412 X 914 `, due to uncompleted in media query section ðŸ˜‰
